		<h1>Data Science Academy @ UCR</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Hosted at the University of California, Riverside, the Data Science Academy was started by professor Paea LePendu. Our aim is to introduce one of
			the most popular and insightful field in Computer Science to <b>K-12 students</b>. Please read more about this program in the
			<a href="/about">About DSA</a> page.
			
			<br/><br/>
			Currently, we are hoping to host a new Data Science Academy cohort during the 2022-23 school year.

		<h1> Lessons </h1>
		<br/>
		<p>
			We host a variety of lessons throughout our program. With these lessons, we aim to instill the importance of learning Data Science, privacy,
			as well as many skills needed to manipulate and analyze datasets.
		</p>

		<p>
			These lessons are produced both by professor Paea LePendu, as well as some of our DSA Leaders. These lessons include skillsets such as basic Python
			programming, learning how to analyze datasets, Machine Learning basics, word cloud generation, data visualization, as well as chat bots. With these
			lessons, we aim to not only provide the breadth of knowledge that students need to succeed in a Data Science career, but we also wish to motivate
			students to pursue a Computer Science or Data Science profession.

		<h1> Activities </h1>

		<br/>

		<p>
			While learning is extremely important, we wholeheartedly believe that fun, relaxation, and reflection are equally valuable to absorb new concepts.
			We therefore host a variety of activities for students to do in between the lessons and main Data Science learning. With these activities, we hope 
			that students are able to get away from the seriousness of Data Science and programming, and reflect on how these concepts can be applied in a fun,
			entertaining way.
			
		</p>

		<p>
			In the past, these activities have included fun icebreakers, tours of the University of California, Riverside, fun implementations of Data Science
			concepts such as Google's Quickdraw, bingo, and many more. And while these activities do not take up much of our time in the program, they are
			essential to ensure that studens remain interested in the field.
